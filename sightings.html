            1966: First sighting in POINT PLEASANT, W.Va. – Two gravediggers in
            Clendenin, West Virginia saw a black figure fly over their heads
            while digging a grave in a cemetery. They didn’t know it then, but
            they are credited with being the first people to see the famous
            Mothman.

            The most infamous sighting of Mothman was on December 15th, 1967.
            Locals said they saw Mothman on top of–or flying over–the Silver
            Bridge, which was a suspension bridge over the Ohio River that
            connected Point Pleasant, West Virginia to Gallipolis, Ohio.
            According to Mothman lore, shortly after the creature was spotted on
            the bridge, the bridge collapsed, resulting in the deaths of 46
            people. An investigation into the disaster found that a fracture in
            a suspension chain was the cause.

          <li>
            Mothman has been allegedly sighted at other disastrous events since
            the bridge collapse, with people claiming to have seen the creature
            before earthquakes, tsunamis, and even the 9/11 terrorist attack.
            This leaves locals and storytellers split on whether Mothman should
            be considered an evil or benevolent creature. Some say the creature
            is either bad luck or causing these disasters in some way, but
            others speculate Mothman may be able to see into the future, and
            that the monster appears to warn people of impending doom.
